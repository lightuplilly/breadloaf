    <h1>Different types of cat loaves</h1>
    <h3>by Lillian Harrison</h3>
    <p>There are several different types of cat loaves. Basically different positions that cats sit in. First there is the half loaf. The half loaf is where the front paws are out where you can see them and the back paws are tucked in where you cannot see them. 
      
      The next one is the classic loaf. This position is where all paws are tucked in and head is up. The last one: the long loaf. The long loaf is where the cat is in a classic loaf position, but their chin is against the floor. It makes them one long line of cat!
    
      Now you know your loaf positions.
